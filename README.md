Image-Based Detection of Chemically Induced Ripening in Fruits
===============================================================

This project presents a non-invasive deep learning-based approach to detect artificially ripened fruits (specifically bananas) using image classification and hybrid feature extraction techniques. It addresses a critical public health issue â€” the use of harmful chemicals such as calcium carbide in fruit ripening.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------

The widespread use of chemicals such as calcium carbide for artificial ripening of fruits poses a serious health hazard. Traditional detection methods are either manual or lab-based, making them unsuitable for large-scale market screening. This project introduces an image-based detection system that uses computer vision and deep learning to automatically differentiate between naturally and chemically ripened bananas.

Using pre-trained models (InceptionV3 and EfficientNetB0) for hybrid feature extraction and a stacked ensemble of machine learning classifiers for final prediction, the model achieves accurate classification without chemical testing. Results demonstrate strong reliability in identifying subtle visual differences caused by chemical ripening.

Technologies Used
-----------------

- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow and Keras
  - InceptionV3
  - EfficientNetB0
- OpenCV (image loading and preprocessing)
- scikit-learn (classifiers, stacking, evaluation)
- XGBoost (gradient boosting classifier)
- Matplotlib (visualization)
- TQDM (progress display)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Model Architecture
------------------

1. **Feature Extraction**
   - InceptionV3 and EfficientNetB0 (pre-trained on ImageNet) are used to extract deep features from 299x299 banana images.
   - Their output vectors are concatenated to form a hybrid feature representation.

2. **Classification**
   - A Stacking Ensemble Classifier is trained using the following base learners:
     - XGBoost
     - K-Nearest Neighbors
     - Logistic Regression
     - Gradient Boosting
   - The final estimator is XGBoost.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How the System Works
---------------------

1. Load images from the dataset folders: `with_carbide/` and `without_carbide/`
2. Preprocess images using InceptionV3 and EfficientNetB0 preprocessing pipelines.
3. Extract deep features from each image.
4. Concatenate feature vectors to form hybrid representations.
5. Train a stacking classifier on the feature vectors and labels.
6. Predict new input images using the trained model and display results with confidence scores.
