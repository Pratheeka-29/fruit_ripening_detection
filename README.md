# 🍌 Image-Based Detection of Chemically Induced Ripening in Fruits

This project presents a **non-invasive deep learning-based approach** to detect artificially ripened fruits (specifically bananas) using image classification and hybrid feature extraction techniques. It addresses a critical public health issue — the use of harmful chemicals like **calcium carbide** in fruit ripening.

---

## 🔍 Abstract

The widespread use of chemicals such as **calcium carbide** for artificial ripening of fruits poses a serious health hazard. Traditional detection methods are either manual or lab-based, making them unsuitable for large-scale market screening. This project introduces an **image-based detection system** that uses computer vision and deep learning to automatically differentiate between **naturally** and **chemically ripened bananas**.

Using pre-trained models (**InceptionV3** and **EfficientNetB0**) for hybrid feature extraction and a **stacked ensemble** of machine learning classifiers for final prediction, the model achieves accurate classification without chemical testing. Results show high reliability in identifying subtle visual differences caused by artificial ripening.

## 📊 Model Architecture

### 🔹 Feature Extraction
- **InceptionV3** and **EfficientNetB0** models (pre-trained on ImageNet) extract deep features from resized banana images (299x299).
- Their output vectors are concatenated to form a **hybrid feature representation**.

### 🔹 Classification
A **Stacking Ensemble Classifier** is trained using:
- **Base Learners**: XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting
- **Final Estimator**: XGBoost

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Load Images** from `with_carbide` and `without_carbide` folders
2. **Preprocess** using Keras preprocessors
3. **Extract deep features** using InceptionV3 and EfficientNetB0
4. **Train Stacking Classifier** on hybrid features
5. **Evaluate model** using accuracy and classification report
6. **Predict** new banana image with confidence scores and display output
